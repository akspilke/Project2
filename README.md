# Project2
In order to run this project, one needs to decide on which potential to insert, these are different for the three cases: one electron,
two non-interacting electrons, and two interacting electrons. One also needs to decide on the parameter n and w, the number of gripoints
and the strength of the potential, and which state one is interested in. This is also explained in the comments in the code.
