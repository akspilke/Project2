# Project2
In order to run this project, one needs to decide on which potential to insert, these are different for the three cases: one electron,
two non-interacting electrons, and two interacting electrons. One also needs to decide on the parameter n and w, the number of gridpoints
and the strength of the potential, and which state one is interested in. This is also explained in the comments in the code. In the iPython notebook file, the first cell includes the example code from the lecture, for comparison. Text files and output figures can also be found in this repository.
